# Skeleton Vike

This is an example project to showcase/test if Vike is a suitable option for our agnostic sandbox environments.

Structure:
- `src/components` - Our library, this could also be `src/lib` if we want, Vike has no opinion on this.
- `src/pages` - Our routes, this `pages` directory is mandatory for Vike to recognize, it can be placed anywhere though, Vike will just traverse our project and look for a `pages` folder.
